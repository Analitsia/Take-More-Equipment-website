 *
 * ── Why the delivery fee is on BOTH sides ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The customer hands over the machines plus the delivery, so the delivery is
 * income. We then pay a driver, so it is also an expense. Counting it once and
 * not the other way round is the mistake this is shaped to avoid: put it only
 * in the income and every delivered order reports a profit nobody earned; put
 * it only in the costs and every delivered order reports a loss nobody took.
 *
 * Because it appears on both sides it CANCELS out of `marginCents`, which is
 * why this agrees to the cent with `order_economics.margin_cents` in the
 * database — that view reaches the same figure by leaving delivery out
 * entirely. What delivery changes is the PERCENTAGE, and it should: money that
 * passes straight through us is takings we keep nothing of, so a delivered
 * order really does keep a smaller share of a larger total.
 *
 * ── The assumption, stated out loud ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `deliveryFeeCents` is what we CHARGE. What the driver actually costs is not
 * recorded anywhere in this system, so using the fee for both sides assumes
 * delivery breaks even. If a real driver cost is ever recorded, it belongs
 * here in place of the fee — and only then will the percentage be exact.
