 * Open every ops page as a real signed-in staff member and assert it renders.

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The CRM shipped with two queries that typechecked, built cleanly, and 500'd
 * the moment somebody opened /leads. Both were PostgREST embed failures —
 * `lead_interests` points at `items` twice so the join was ambiguous, and
 * `lead_events.actor_id` pointed at auth.users which has no route to
 * staff_profiles. Neither is visible to `tsc`, because the relationship is
 * resolved at runtime from foreign keys.
 *
 * packages/db/tests/rls.test.mjs now asserts those specific embeds, but that
 * only covers the joins somebody remembered to add. This covers the pages: if a
 * route throws for any reason at all, this fails.
 *
 * It signs in as a throwaway staff account created through the admin API, drives
 * the app over HTTP with the same cookie @supabase/ssr writes, and deletes the
 * account afterwards.
