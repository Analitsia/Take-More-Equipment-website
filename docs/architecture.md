# Take More Equipment — Platform Architecture & Build Plan

> Status: **approved 2026-08-04**. This is the reference document for all build sessions.
> Phase 1 (website MVP) is the next session's scope.

## Context

Take More Catering Equipment (Pty) Ltd, Cape Town, buys commercial catering equipment at
auction, refurbishes it, and resells it. Today `takemoreequipment.co.za` is a single static
HTML page on Hostinger with an 841 KB screenshot embedded as base64 — effectively a
placeholder. There is no catalogue, no checkout, no operational system. Stock is tracked
outside any software.

We are building two things against one database:

1. **A premium public storefront** — branded, fast, shoppable.
2. **An ops PWA (the ERP)** — where staff intake items, photograph them, price them,
   publish them, take orders, and read their own KPIs.

### The insight that shapes everything

For a refurbisher of auction goods, **a product and an inventory unit are the same thing.**
Each unit is a one-of-one: its own photos, its own condition, its own cost basis, its own
price. There is no "SKU with 47 in stock."

This removes the hard parts of ecommerce platforms — variants, stock levels, oversell
allocation, promotions engines — and leaves the part no platform does well: the
**intake → refurb → list → sell → hand over** lifecycle with per-unit margin tracking.

So the architecture inverts the usual one: **the ERP is the product, and the website is a
read-projection of it.** A single `items.status` column drives both the warehouse board and
public visibility. One database, one truth, no sync layer.

### Decisions locked with Carlo

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Catalogue owner | Supabase Postgres, sole source of truth |
| Payments | Tiered: card + instant EFT + deposit-to-reserve |
| Fulfilment | Warehouse collection, quoted local delivery, national courier for small items |
| CRM / nurture | In-house on Postgres (no GoHighLevel) |

---

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Monorepo | Turborepo + pnpm | Two apps share DB types and domain rules; separate repos guarantee drift |
| Framework | Next.js (App Router), TypeScript | One framework for both apps; server actions keep secrets server-side |
| Styling | Tailwind + shadcn/ui | Carlo owns design; shadcn is unstyled primitives, not a look to fight |
| DB / Auth / Storage / Realtime | Supabase | Postgres + RLS + staff auth + image storage + live board updates in one service |
| Payments | **Paystack** | One integration gives card + Instant EFT (Ozow) + Capitec Pay in ZAR, to R100k |
| Background jobs | Inngest | Durable retries for payment→WhatsApp; cron for the stock-matching engine |
| Email | Resend + React Email | Transactional receipts and nurture sends |
| WhatsApp | Meta Cloud API direct | No BSP markup; we have a developer, so skip the reseller layer |
| Courier | Bob Go | Aggregates Courier Guy, Aramex, RAM, PostNet behind one API — small items only |
| Hosting | Vercel (two projects, one repo) | Independent deploys from separate root dirs — change one app without rebuilding the other |

### Explicitly rejected

- **Shopify** — dual-write against Supabase forever, plus 0.6–2% on top of the gateway
  because Shopify Payments isn't available in SA. Uploading 12 photos of a unique item from
  a warehouse phone is also a poor flow in Shopify admin.
- **Medusa v2** — solves variants/multi-region/promotions, none of which exist here, and
  adds a second backend to operate.
- **Airtable as system of record** — no RLS, API rate limits, per-seat pricing, no
  transactional integrity. Fine as a scratchpad, wrong as truth.
- **GoHighLevel** — the nurture feature is a SQL join between leads and items. Putting
  contacts in GHL means that join crosses a network boundary and syncs both ways forever.

`packages/core` is the load-bearing one. Every status transition, SKU format, and margin
calculation lives there and is imported by both apps — so the website can never disagree
with the ERP about what "sold" means. Its **zero runtime dependencies** are a real
constraint, not an accident: it is bundled into storefront client code *and* executed by
plain `node` in the parity suite. Anything needing a dependency goes elsewhere — which is
why `@takemore/observability` is its own package and why `verifyTurnstile` is a subpath
export (`@takemore/core/turnstile`) rather than part of the barrel.

## Data model (core tables)

**`items`** — one row per physical unit. The centre of the system.

- Identity: `id`, `sku` (a four-character code, e.g. `A042`), `slug`
- Classification: `category_id`, `subcategory_id`, `brand`, `model`, `condition_grade`
- Content: `title`, `description`, `specs` (jsonb), `width/depth/height_mm`, `weight_kg`
- Money: `list_price_cents` (the ask), `retail_price_cents` (what it costs new — an
  anchor, never charged), `sale_price_cents` (what it went for)
- Lifecycle: `status`, `published_at`, `arrived_at`, `sold_at`
- Ops: `created_by`

Stock is **not filed by shelf**. There was a `location_code` column until August 2026; it was
removed in `20260819120000_no_shelf_codes.sql` because nothing was being filed that way and an
optional field nobody fills is a question on a form and a fragment in every search result. A
machine is found by its code and its printed label.

**Cost is NOT on this table.** RLS is row-level and cannot hide a column from one signed-in
user while showing it to another, so every cent spent on a machine lives in `item_costs` —
one row per kind, guarded by `app.can_see_costs()`. That turned an impossible column problem
into a trivial row one. Since August 2026 that guard is every approved account rather than
manager-and-above; the structure is unchanged, so re-restricting it is one function body.

**The code** is generated by `app.next_sku()` from a sequence: `A001 … A999`, then `B001`,
over an alphabet with no I, L, O or U. It is short because it is written on a machine by
hand and read back into a search box. It was `TME-2608-0417` until
`20260819090000_short_item_codes.sql` renumbered every row; `app.sku_renumber_2026` is the
permanent old-to-new map.

**Two independent fields, deliberately:**
- `status` — `refurbishing ↔ listed ↔ reserved ↔ sold`, a complete graph, every edge at
  `staff` (`20260808120000_four_stages.sql`). `intake`, `ready` and `handed_over` survive in
  the enum only because a value cannot be dropped; nothing points at them.
- `published_at` — whether the public site shows it

The two are separate so a machine can be off the site without changing stage and vice versa.
Note that a sold machine does **not** stay on the site: `stage.live` is false for `sold` in
`packages/core/src/status.ts`, and both `setStage()` and `confirm_order_paid()` clear
`published_at`. An earlier draft of this document said the opposite.

**`orders` / `order_lines`** — one in-person sale, and one row per machine on it. Payment is
**recorded, never processed**: `payment_method` is `card_machine` or `bank_transfer`, and
the card machine and the bank are what actually move the money. `order_lines` snapshots the
asking price at the moment a machine was added, so a later reprice cannot rewrite what a
customer was quoted, and carries **no cost columns** — `order_line_economics` reads
`item_costs` live, because a stored copy could disagree with its own ledger.

**Other tables:** `item_media` (ordered photos/video), `item_costs`, `categories`,
`subcategories`, `tags`, `leads`, `lead_interests`, `lead_events`, `outreach_campaigns`,
`outreach_messages`, `staff_profiles`, `access_requests`, `cron_runs`, `activity_log`.
There is no `customers` table — that is `leads` — and no `payments` or `shipments`.

Costs and margin are protected by RLS and never selected by the public app — the storefront
reads a view (`public_items`) that does not expose them.

### The one genuine concurrency risk

Items are qty=1, so two buyers can be in checkout simultaneously. Reservation must happen at
**checkout initiation**, not payment success:

```sql
UPDATE items SET status='reserved', reserved_until=now()+interval '20 minutes'
WHERE id = $1 AND status = 'listed'
RETURNING id;   -- zero rows = someone beat them to it
```

A conditional update inside a transaction. An Inngest cron releases expired holds. This is
the single most important correctness detail in the build.

---

## Payments

Paystack initialises a transaction server-side and the customer picks their channel at
Paystack's hosted checkout. Fulfilment is driven **only by the `charge.success` webhook**,
never by the browser redirect.

Three paths, chosen by item value:

| Value | Method | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Under ~R10k | Card | 2.9% + R1.50 |
| R10k–R100k | Instant EFT (Ozow) or Capitec Pay | ~1.5%, no chargebacks |
| Any / high value | **Deposit to reserve** — 10–20% online, balance on collection | % of deposit only |

The deposit path is what makes high-ticket work. A R50k oven at full card cost bleeds
~R1,450; many SA cards also carry online limits below R50k, so card *cannot physically
complete* those sales. A R7,500 deposit locks the item, and the balance settles by manual
EFT or on-site card at handover. Manual EFT is supported natively: an
`awaiting_payment_verification` state where a staff member confirms against the bank
statement and releases the item.

Webhook handling must verify the `x-paystack-signature` HMAC, be idempotent on
`reference`, and re-verify amount against the order before marking paid.

## Build phases

Carlo's stated sequence is website first, then ERP. One amendment: the site has nothing to
display until items exist. So **Phase 1 ships the schema plus a minimal item-entry form**,
and Phase 2 grows that form into the full ops PWA. The website is never blocked, and the
schema is designed once rather than retrofitted.

### Phase 0 — Foundations
Monorepo, Supabase project, schema + RLS, staff auth, two Vercel projects, CI. Seed
categories from real stock.

### Phase 1 — Website MVP *(next session)*
Brand system, catalogue with faceted filtering, item detail pages built around photography,
search, enquiry form + WhatsApp CTA, SEO/OG/schema.org `Product`, plus a bare-bones
`/admin/items/new` so real stock can go live. **No checkout yet** — enquiry-driven, which is
how the business already sells.

### Phase 2 — Ops PWA (the ERP)
Installable PWA, mobile-first. Fast intake flow: photograph → classify → price → publish.
Client-side image compression before upload (warehouse phones, weak signal). Kanban board
over `status`, realtime-synced. STALE: costs are visible to every approved account
(`20260819090100`) and ranks are gone (`20260819110000`).

### Phase 3 — Orders — **built, but not the half this once described**
What shipped is the counter, not the checkout: **an in-person sale screen** in ops
(`/orders`). Pick or capture the customer, add machines by typing the four-character code,
see the cost floor and the new-price anchor while negotiating, quote delivery by distance,
type what was actually agreed, and record whether the money came by card machine or bank
transfer. Payment is **recorded, never processed** — no gateway, no VAT, no invoice PDF.

The load-bearing part is `confirm_order_paid()`, which is the first thing in the history of
this codebase to write `items.sale_price_cents`. Every money view computes revenue as
`coalesce(sale_price_cents, list_price_cents)`, so until it existed the dashboard reported
**asking** prices and called them revenue, and a discount was invisible to the business that
gave it. The views did not change; they became true. `scripts/test-order-loop.mjs` asserts
exactly that, and is the reason it exists.

Still not built, and not currently planned: Paystack, online checkout, the reservation
transaction, a webhook handler, invoice PDFs, and the manual-EFT verification queue.

### Phase 4 — Notifications
WhatsApp Cloud API + Resend. Payment confirmation (utility template, free inside the 24h
service window), then a personalised handover message built from the buyer's checkout
answers. In-app notification when an item sells.

### Phase 5 — Lead nurture & stock matching
Capture enquiries as `leads` with `lead_interests` tags. A nightly Inngest job matches newly
published items against past interests and queues a personalised WhatsApp/email outreach for
staff approval before sending. Marketing templates cost ~R1.50 each, so approval before
send is deliberate.

### Phase 6 — Labels, codes, KPIs
**The barcode plan was abandoned, deliberately.** A Code128 label needs a thermal printer, a
ribbon, a scanner and a bridge between a browser and a USB device, and it buys speed at a
counter that serves a handful of customers a day. What it was actually for — identifying a
machine across a warehouse — is served by a code short enough to write on a sticker with a
marker and type back with one hand: `A042`. `/items/[id]/label` prints one.

If a scanner is ever bought, nothing here blocks it: a scanner is a keyboard, `A042` is what
it would type, and `app.normalise_item_code()` already reads it.

The KPI half: revenue, gross margin per unit and category, days-to-sale (rotation),
sell-through rate.

> **Both halves are built.** `money_by_month`, `money_by_category` and
> `money_position` (`supabase/migrations/20260809090500_money_kpis.sql`) back the
> Dashboard: revenue and margin by month, margin and sell-through by category,
> days-to-sale, and capital sitting in stock over ninety days old. All three are
> `security_invoker` views guarded on `app.can_see_costs()`, which since
> `20260819090100` answers yes for every approved account — the guard stays so
> that re-restricting is one function body rather than an audit of every screen.
>
> Labels and short codes shipped in August 2026. **Shelf-space efficiency
> is not built and its spec above is stale** — `dimensions_mm` became centimetres
> in `20260808090300_dimensions_typed_as_centimetres.sql`.

Bob Go courier integration slots into Phase 3 or 6 depending on how soon small items ship.

## Security baseline

- RLS enabled on **every** public-schema table; policies use `auth.uid()`, never
  client-supplied IDs. Indexes on every column referenced in a policy.
- `service_role` key exists only in server environments — never in a client bundle, never in
  a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` var. This is the single most common way Supabase apps get breached.
- Storefront reads the `public_items` view only; cost and margin are unreachable from the
  public app by construction, not by convention.
- Paystack webhook: signature verification + idempotency + server-side amount re-check.
- Staff ranks were removed in August 2026 (`20260819110000_one_team_no_ranks.sql`). The
  `app_role` column and enum remain, and `app.at_least()` ignores what it is asked for —
  which is what makes putting ranks back one function body. `app.is_owner()` is separate and
  still guards the team roster and the hard-delete policies.
- Policies tested through the client SDK — the Supabase SQL editor bypasses RLS and will
  give false confidence.

---

## Verification

- **Schema/RLS:** query every table as an anonymous client and assert `cost_price` and
  `leads` are unreachable; assert what a `staff` account may and may not do. Run via the
  Supabase MCP tools against the project.
- **Reservation race:** fire two concurrent checkout initiations at one item; exactly one
  must succeed and the other must receive a clean "no longer available."
- **Payments:** Paystack test keys end-to-end for card, Instant EFT, and deposit. Replay the
  same webhook three times and assert exactly one order transition. Send a webhook with a
  bad signature and assert rejection.
- **Publish loop:** create an item in ops → confirm it appears on the site within one
  revalidation cycle → mark sold → confirm the SOLD badge shows and the item *stays* visible
  → unpublish → confirm it disappears.
- **Field test:** a staff member intakes five real items on their own phone over warehouse
  wifi, timed. If intake takes longer than ~90 seconds per item, the flow needs rework —
  adoption dies on friction here.
- **Lighthouse** on the storefront: performance and accessibility ≥ 90 on mobile.

---

## Open items for later sessions

- Brand direction, references, component style — Carlo supplies.
- Accounts/keys needed before Phase 3: Paystack (KYC approval required before EFT and
  Capitec Pay appear at checkout), Meta Business + WhatsApp sender, Resend domain, Bob Go.
- Domain/DNS cutover from Hostinger to Vercel.
- Whether buyers get accounts, or checkout stays guest-only. Guest-only is assumed for now.
- **A second Supabase project for tests.** The live suites currently write to
  production and clean up after themselves, which is why they run only on pushes
  to `main` and on demand rather than on a schedule.
- **Next 16.** The only outstanding `npm audit` findings (`postcss`, `sharp`) are
  transitive through Next 15 and not resolvable within it.
- **Real-world facts and service keys** — the whole of
  [`launch-checklist.md`](launch-checklist.md), which is what stands between this
  and a public domain.
