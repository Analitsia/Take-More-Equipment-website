    // No padding under the frame, and no radius on its bottom two corners:

    // padding removed here, so the hero occupies exactly the band it did.

      {/* A *minimum* height, not a fixed one — that is the whole fix.

          The two text blocks below used to be pinned to opposite ends of this
          frame with `absolute top-32` and `absolute bottom-0`. Their heights
          come from the words in them; the frame's height came from the
          viewport; and nothing whatsoever related the two. So on any screen
          short enough that 90vh was less than city-line + headline + strapline,
          they simply printed over each other — the headline through the "Cape
          Town" and "Rebuilt in our workshop" lines. It needed no unusual
          screen: a 390×844 phone already overlapped by 2px, a 360×640 one by
          7px, and the framed preview on the Website tab of the ops app — a
          wide, short box — by 32px.

          Now the same three blocks are laid out in flow, in a column, with a
          growing gap between them, so the frame can never be shorter than what
          it holds: the gap absorbs the slack when there is room to spare, and
          the frame grows when there is not. The minimum reproduces the old
          fixed height exactly (less the padding above, which used to be inside
          the old measurement), so on any screen that already fitted, nothing
          moves by a pixel.

          Both terms of each minimum carry the half of that padding the wrapper
          no longer spends below the frame — 474→482 and 58vh-1rem→58vh-0.5rem
          on a phone, 488→504 and 90vh-2rem→90vh-1rem from md. Frame plus
          padding therefore still measures max(490px, 58vh) and max(520px,
          90vh), exactly as before; the hero simply owns the last 8/16px of it
          instead of leaving them empty. */}

        {/* Scrim is heavier than the source template's — that hero used an already-dark
            studio car shot, whereas kitchen interiors are lit and busy. It is also
            what lets the hero survive having no photograph at all: over a flat card
            colour this same gradient reads as an intentional dark hero. */}
        <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-background/70 via-background/50 to-background/95"></div>

        {/* The floor of the hero, dissolved into the page.
            The scrim above ends at 95% — dark, but still 5% of a lit kitchen
            against a page that is flat #080805, and that last 5% was the visible
            cut. This takes the bottom band the rest of the way to opaque, so the
            photograph runs out before the frame does and there is nothing left to
            see an edge of.

            Vertical only, as asked: full-bleed left to right, so the side edges
            of the frame keep their crop and simply darken out of sight along with
            everything else near the floor.

            The stops are smoothstep (3t²−2t³) sampled every 10%, not a plain
            two-stop ramp. A linear fade has a corner in it at both ends — the eye
            reads the sudden onset of darkening as a horizontal line across the
            photo, and the arrival at black as a second one. Smoothstep is flat at
            both, so the fade has no beginning and no end you can point at, which
            is the whole job. Written as explicit rgba rather than `transparent`
            so the ramp interpolates within the background colour and never dips
            through a different one.

            Proportional, so a tall desktop hero fades over a distance that suits
            it, with a floor for short frames and a ceiling so a very tall one
            does not surrender half the photograph to the gradient. */}

        {/* Deliberately uncapped, same as the headline row below it — capping
            this at max-w-[1440px] would agree with the navbar but disagree
            with the headline, since that row is plain padding too. See
            headerRow() in headerLayout.ts: the overlay navbar is the one
            that stays uncapped past 1440px, to agree with this.

            The old `top-20 md:top-32` is now the same distance expressed as
            padding, so the row starts where it always did. It takes two
            elements rather than one: the padding is on this wrapper, and the
            flex row inside is the bare, unpadded positioning root the centered
            block is placed against. An absolutely positioned child measures
            from its container's *padding* box, so a single padded element
            would put that block's `top-0` above the padding it is meant to sit
            below — level with the top of the photo.

            `z-10` without `relative` is deliberate: this is a flex item, and
            z-index applies to flex items whatever their position. Adding
            `relative` would make this the centered block's containing block,
            which is exactly the mistake described above. */}

                fixes that on its own. Position is a separate problem: as the

                landed wherever the "Cape Town" text and the third block's

            It is written as two lines, with a hard <br/> after "Kit,". Putting
            the Instagram/WhatsApp column beside it costs this one roughly
            330px plus the lg:pl-12 gutter, which took the headline's box from
            652px down to 531px — narrower than "Restaurant-Grade Kit," needs
            at text-7xl. So the line broke again on its own, and between the lg
            breakpoint and about 1180px the headline silently rendered as three
            lines, or four from 1024–1080px, before snapping back to two on a
            wider screen. A ~150px-wide band of laptop widths, and squarely
            where the framed preview on the ops app's Website tab sits.

            Splitting at xl instead means the columns only divide once both
            halves fit at full size; below that the CTAs use the same stacked
            form they already use on a tablet. The alternative — stepping the
            headline down a size for the band — would have to drop it two
            steps, to text-5xl, to fit 531px, and a 72→48→72px jump across
            150px of width is more conspicuous than the stack. */}
