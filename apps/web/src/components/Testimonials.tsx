 * here renders until somebody sets a date against one. Attributing words to a
 * named person who never said them is an advertising standards and consumer
 * protection problem, not a content nit, so the default is silence.
 *
 * The avatars used to be generated stock faces standing in for customers, which

 * invented face, and it reads as a deliberate choice rather than a missing
 * image.
