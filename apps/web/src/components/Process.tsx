          one: it was the only accent glow between the catalogue and the footer,
          and without it everything from here down reads as flat black. It suits
          this section better anyway — this is where the argument is made.

          Two things it must keep. `overflow-hidden` on the section above, and
          the 120vw clamp: at a fixed 600px the blur is wider than a phone and
          widens the document, which pushed every section below the right edge.
          Nothing here is a scroll container and nothing is sticky, so clipping
          costs the section nothing. */}
