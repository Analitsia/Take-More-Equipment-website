 * Every page a crawler should know about.
 *
 * Static routes first, then one entry per published item. Tolerant of an
 * empty catalogue by construction — on launch day the stock list is `[]` and
 * the sitemap is just the static pages, which is correct. The Journal only
 * appears once a post is verified, matching the navigation.
 *
 * Absolute URLs are built from the launch domain rather than metadataBase so
 * this file needs no request context and works at build time.
