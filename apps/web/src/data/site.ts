 *
 * assertProductionReady() runs here, at module load, because every page imports
 * this file. While `launchState` is "pre-launch" it warns and the build
 * proceeds; once that is flipped to "live" it throws, so a storefront whose
 * CTAs point at an invented number cannot deploy. Local and preview builds are
