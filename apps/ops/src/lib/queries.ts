/**
 * Reads for the ops app.
 *
 * Everything here goes through the staff client, so RLS decides what comes
 * back. A staff member querying costs gets an empty list rather than an error,
 * which is why the UI checks the role before rendering a costs panel at all —
 * an empty panel would read as "this item cost nothing".
 *
 * ── Why `orEmpty` exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Several of these used to be `const { data } = await client...` with the error
 * simply not destructured, then `data ?? []`. That reads as tolerance, but it
 * conflates two very different situations: "RLS says you may not see any of
 * these" and "the query failed". Both rendered as an empty panel.
 *
 * In an ERP that is the worst class of bug available. A manager opens Money,
 * reads a margin of R0 off a failed query, and believes it. Nothing anywhere
 * said otherwise — not the screen, not the logs.
 *
 * So: still return the empty list, because a page that renders beats a page
 * that 500s. But say so somewhere. Pages where the distinction changes a
 * decision — Money in particular — also show the reader that a query failed.
