/**
 * The draft a staff member sends.
 *
 * Written here rather than in SQL deliberately. The matcher decides WHO should
 * hear about a machine — that is a rule, and rules live in Postgres where they
 * cannot be forgotten. What to SAY is a different kind of decision: it depends
 * on the storefront's URL, on how this business talks, and on whether the person
 * sending it wants to change a word before they do. None of that belongs in a
 * trigger.
 *
 * Three things every message must do, in this order:
 *   1. Use their name.
 *   2. Say what THEY told us they wanted, in their words where we have them.
 *      This is the whole difference between "we remembered you" and a blast.
 *   3. Give them the machine and a link, and then stop.
 *
 * No photos are attached. On WhatsApp the link preview renders the item's own
 * OG image — which the storefront already generates from its first photo — so
 * the picture arrives without a 4 MB upload through somebody's phone data. On
 * email the template embeds the item's photographs and links its clips; see
 * EmailMedia in lib/email.ts for why embedded and linked rather than attached.
 *
 * ONE MESSAGE IS ABOUT ONE MACHINE, ALWAYS. A customer with two recorded wants
 * and two matching machines gets two emails, each quoting the want it answers,
 * because "we also have this other thing" is a catalogue and "you asked for a
 * cold room, here is a cold room" is a reason to reply. The database enforces
 * the same shape: outreach_messages carries a single item_id and a single
 * interest_id.
