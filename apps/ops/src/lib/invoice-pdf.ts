/**
 * The invoice, drawn.
 *
 * ── Why a PDF and not a print stylesheet ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The label page in (print) proves an HTML page comes out of a printer
 * perfectly well, and printing was the easy third of this. The other two thirds
 * are not: a customer needs a FILE — to be sent to them, to be filed, to be
 * opened in six months when the machine breaks — and "press Ctrl+P and choose
 * Save as PDF" is not a file, it is an instruction that produces a different
 * document depending on who followed it and in which browser.
 *
 * So the PDF is the artefact and printing means printing the PDF. One layout,
 * three destinations. An HTML twin for the printer would be a second layout
 * that starts identical and stays identical for about a month.
 *
 * ── Why pdf-lib, and why NOT @react-pdf/renderer ──────────────────────────
 *
 * @react-pdf/renderer was the first choice and had to be abandoned, for a
 * reason worth writing down so nobody tries it again:
 *
 *   Next 15 does not use the React in node_modules for server code. It vendors
 *   its own — 19.2.0-canary here — so JSX compiled inside this app produces
 *   `Symbol(react.transitional.element)` elements. @react-pdf/renderer picks
 *   its internal reconciler by reading `React.version` from node_modules, sees
 *   18.3.1, loads the React 18 reconciler, and that reconciler does not
 *   recognise a React 19 element. Every render dies on "Minified React error
 *   #31" from inside a PDF library, which is a spectacularly unhelpful place
 *   for a React version mismatch to surface.
 *
 *   Pinning around that means pinning two React copies to each other across a
 *   boundary neither app controls. The next Next upgrade breaks it again.
 *
 * pdf-lib has no React in it at all, so the coupling does not exist. It is pure
 * JavaScript with no WASM and no font files on disk — Helvetica and Courier are
 * in every PDF reader by specification — so it also rules out the other way
 * this fails on Vercel, which is a bundler rewriting a path to a .ttf.
 *
 * The price is that there is no flexbox: every position below is computed.
 * For one page of A4 whose shape never changes that is a fair trade, and it
 * buys exact control over where a rule sits.
 *
 * ── The document is the input, and the only input ─────────────────────────
 *
 * This takes an InvoiceDocument and no database client, deliberately. It cannot
 * accidentally read a machine's current name or the customer's current phone
 * number because it has no way to reach them. Everything it prints was frozen
 * by issue_invoice() at the moment the customer was standing at the counter.
