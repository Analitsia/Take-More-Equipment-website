/**
 * What the customer takes away.
 *
 * ── The WhatsApp problem, and why this is not one button ──────────────────
 *
 * `wa.me?text=` is the mechanism every other send in this app uses, and it
 * CANNOT carry a file. There is no parameter for one and there never has been;
 * click-to-chat pre-fills a message and stops. So "send them the invoice on
 * WhatsApp" has exactly three implementations and this uses two of them:
 *
 *   1. THE SHARE SHEET. navigator.share() with a File hands the operating
 *      system's own share menu the actual PDF, and WhatsApp is one of the
 *      destinations in it. It is the only route on which the document travels
 *      as a document.
 *
 *   2. wa.me PLUS A DOWNLOAD. The PDF is saved and WhatsApp opens ON THAT
 *      CUSTOMER'S CHAT with the message already typed, and the person attaches
 *      the file.
 *
 *   3. The Meta Cloud API, which would attach it with no tap at all, and needs
 *      business verification, an approved template per wording, and a cost per
 *      message. OutreachQueue already made this call for match messages —
 *      "worth it when the tapping gets tedious, not before" — and an invoice is
 *      sent far less often than those are.
 *
 * ── Which one, and why the device decides ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This used to offer the share sheet to anything whose browser SAID it could
 * share files, and that was wrong on a desktop. Chrome on a laptop answers yes
 * to canShare({files}) and then opens an OS share panel — a slow, unfamiliar
 * menu that does not know who the customer is, when wa.me would have gone
 * straight to their chat with the words already in the box, which is exactly
 * what the outreach queue does and what people here expect.
 *
 * So: a touch device gets the share sheet, because the file itself travelling
 * is worth picking the chat by hand. Everything else goes straight to the chat.
 * The trade is real and it is stated on screen rather than hidden — on a phone
 * the share sheet cannot be told which chat to open, and on a desktop the file
 * cannot be attached for you. Neither limit is ours to remove; WhatsApp exposes
 * no way to do both at once outside the Cloud API.
 *
 * ── Why the PDF is fetched before anybody clicks ──────────────────────────
 *
 * navigator.share() has to be called during the gesture that triggered it.
 * Awaiting a fetch() first spends that activation, and Safari refuses the share
 * with NotAllowedError — on iPhones, which is most of the phones this will run
 * on. So on a touch device the file is fetched as soon as the document exists
 * and the handler only ever hands over something it already has. It is about
 * four kilobytes. A desktop never needs it and never fetches it.
