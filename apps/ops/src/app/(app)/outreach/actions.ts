 * and last_contacted_at are handled by database triggers, so there is nothing
 * here to forget.
 *
 * ONE SEND PATH. deliverEmail() below is the only function in the app that puts
 * a match in front of Resend, whether the suggestion came from the nightly
 * sweep or from somebody choosing a machine for a customer they are on the
 * phone to. That is deliberate: consent, the opt-out, the frequency caps and
 * "is this machine actually still for sale" are checked in one place, so the
 * deliberate path cannot quietly be the lenient one.
 *
 * The caps are re-applied HERE and not only in SQL, because the matcher applies
 * them when queueing and a suggestion can sit in the queue for a week. The
 * question that matters is whether we may write to this person about this want
 * at the moment somebody taps, not at the moment the machine arrived.
